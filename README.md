Today I have completed the Jira Ticket Management clone.

It is used by companies to categorize service requests, incidents, problems, and prioritizing these requests in a single place, and keeps work on track with goals.
 
 
It includes various features such as
 
Ticket with unique ID
Setting priority of your task
Sort your ticket based on priority
Change priority of ticket with one click
Ticket will be stored in local storage
